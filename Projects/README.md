Robotics Projects
==================

This repository consist of the projects related to robotics applications.

### Project List:

1. Search and Sample Return:

   In this project a Rover navigates around a foreign terrian to search for rock samples. It then maps the samples and the environment followed by picking up those samples.

2. Pick and Place:
   This project walks through path planning of a 6 DoF Kuka robot using forward and inverse kinamatics.

3. 3D Perception Pipeline:
   A 3D vision pipeline is created in this project. Here the objects are segmented from the surface of the table and then individually classified using machine learning. Result of classification can be further used for robotic pick and place.
